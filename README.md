# Boxy Startpage

A startpage is intended to replace the main "new tab" page within your browser.
 
The goal of this project is to allow the user to simply click a button to add new sections which can then have links added into them, allowing the customization of your page to what you find most important front and center. No need to open code editors.

In addition, the startpage comes with a TODO/Task list that stays local to your machine to keep yourself organized
